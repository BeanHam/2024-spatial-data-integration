      "To determine whether the sidewalk runs alongside the road, we can follow these steps:\n",

      "### Step 1: Analyze the input geometries\n",

      "- **Sidewalk**: A series of coordinate points representing the sidewalk geometry.\n",
      "- **Road**: A series of coordinate points representing the road geometry.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Define criteria for \"running alongside\"\n",
      "For a sidewalk to be considered as running alongside a road, the following conditions should generally hold:\n",
      "1. The sidewalk and road should be spatially close to each other.\n",
      "2. The general direction (trend) of the sidewalk should align with the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Compute proximity between sidewalk and road\n",
      "To assess whether the sidewalk is close to the road, we can calculate the minimum distance between the sidewalk and the road. If the minimum distance is below a certain threshold, it indicates that the sidewalk is near the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Check alignment of directions\n",
      "To determine if the sidewalk aligns with the road, we can compare the angles or directions of the two LineStrings. If the directions are similar, it suggests that the sidewalk runs parallel to the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Evaluate the specific example\n",

      "- **Road** starts at `[-122.1534612, 47.6130981]` and ends at `[-122.1528869, 47.6130989]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Proximity analysis:\n",
      "- The starting point of the sidewalk (`[-122.15343690000002, 47.61303290000001]`) is very close to the starting point of the road (`[-122.1534612, 47.6130981]`), with a small vertical separation.\n",
      "- The ending point of the sidewalk (`[-122.152972, 47.61301749999999]`) is also close to the ending point of the road (`[-122.1528869, 47.6130989]`).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Direction analysis:\n",
      "- Both the sidewalk and the road have a predominantly east-west trend, indicating that they are aligned in the same general direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Conclusion\n",
